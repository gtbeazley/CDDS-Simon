1) Start The Game
The screen is brought to the game screen where it waits for me to start the first level

2) Start the first level 
The buttons play a light sequence just like the simon toy. 

3) Try clicking on a button during the sequence
It doesn't break

4) Fail the level 
The screen tells me to retry the level. When I press retry the level, the lives are decreased by one and the sequence starts again with a new randomised sequence.

5) Run out of lives
The game works as intended and tells me to return to the main menu screen. Pressing the blue button returns me to the main menuscreen where i can start the game again.

6) Complete the level 
The screen tells me that i've passed and asks if id like to continue to the next level. Playing the level gives me a completely new sequence.

7) Press the coming soon button 
The button says "Soon TM"

8) Pressing the quit button 
It does exactly what was intended.

9) Summary of the game
- The game works very similarily to the simon toy, the twist is that with each level has a completely different and random sequence.
- The aim is to get to the highest level by completing the button sequences.

10) Anyhting else that is noteworthy
- The game plays as intended, no crashes or problems found in the game
- I would make each level have a faster sequence as you go along
- I want to see what it is thats coming soon.
