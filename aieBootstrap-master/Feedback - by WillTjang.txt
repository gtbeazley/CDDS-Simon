Q: Does the code conform to a consistent standard?
A: I'd say so. Nothing particularly stands out as being out of place.

Q: Is the code well commented, easy to read and understand?
A: Easy to read tbh. Well formatted.

Q: Does the program function as intended?
A: It works fine from my point of view.

Q: Is the code well structured?
A: It's actually fine as it is, but its efficiency can still be improved if you desire.

Q: Is the vector and matrix math used correctly to draw the manipulate the position and orientation of the game objects?
A: They work fine, just as expected.

Q: Is there anything else noteworthy?
A: The tank slides... quite a bit for a tank. Could maybe increase deceleration so it stops sooner.

Q: How would you rate the quality of this project?
A: It works, and there are no memory leaks (tested).

Q: What steps could be taken to resolve any quality issues?
A: Honestly, just work on it some more if you want to improve the quality, since you've finished with the main mechanics. Maybe work on that deceleration.
An idea is you could make some kind of objective for the game e.g. making enemies or obstacles etc.
